Maverick TV, Man Cave, KIDS section, JoyRide, Supremacy, YouTube, Globe TV, Plex are all fixed. | Try out the SPORTS section. Lots of sports channels. And we added Planet MMA for all you UFC fans. | The LIVE channels are back up. | If you haven’t tried the Plex TV, you will find it in APPS/Video Addons. We’re still building the library of Movies and TV shows, but it’s worth a look. | {{Always use the latest version of the AV Edge app. | To check what version is currently installed, click SYSTEM and look for the version number in the bottom right corner of the screen. It starts with 99. | Remember, if you experience sticking when streaming a movie or TV show, try pausing for a minute or 2 at the beginning to allow it to build enough buffer, then click play.}}</title>
