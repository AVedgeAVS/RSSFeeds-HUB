<title> ****** Current version 19.7.11. Last update was 11-July-2019 ****** | 11-July-2019: We've made some changes to AV Edge Hub as some of the repos no longer work. Hopefully we can bring them back sometime soon. | Thereâ€™s a Brand New AV Edge build called AV Edge HUB BG. You'll find it in the BUILD section of the AVEdge HUB app. Check it out and let us know how it looks. | {{Always use the latest version of the AV Edge app. | To check what version is currently installed, click SYSTEM and look for the version number in the bottom right corner of the screen. It starts with 99. | Remember, if you experience sticking when streaming a movie or TV show, try pausing for a minute or 2 at the beginning to allow it to build enough buffer, then click play.}} </title>
