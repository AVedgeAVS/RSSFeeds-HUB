<title> ****** 1-Dec-2018: Current version number is 18.12.1. Last update was 1-Dec-2018| Yep, we changed the app again, so there’s new a version. We added Real Debrid to MOVIES and SHOWS using Exodus, so there’s lots more server links to choose from. | The LIVE menu channels are fixed. | ******* Always use the latest version of the AV Edge app. | To check what version you currently are on, click SYSTEM and look for the version number in the bottom right corner of the screen. It starts with 99. | Remember, if you experience sticking when streaming a movie, try pausing the movie for a minute or 2 at the beginning to allow it to build enough buffer, then click play. ******** </title>
