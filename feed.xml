Thereâ€™s lots of movies and TV shows to stream. Please note, the PLEX account is shared with other AV Edge HUB users. | Enjoy the new AV Edge HUB update! | {{Always use the latest version of the AV Edge app. | To check what version is currently installed, click SETTINGS then scroll down to Services and click on it. The version is listed in Device name.| Remember, if you experience sticking when streaming a movie or TV show, try pausing for a minute or 2 at the beginning to allow it to build enough buffer, then click play.}} </title>
