<title> New version of AVEdge HUB… version 18.8.16!! Run the AVEdge HUB app to install. | We’ve replaced Neptune with the rebuilt Exodus for MOVIES and SHOWS. | In KIDS we’ve added ATF Kids Boxsets with lots of kid movies. | In the LIVE submenu we have you covered for US and UK channels in Man Cave Jen TV. You will also find Canadian live channels for CBC, Global and others. | Check out the Man Cave Flix app in the APPS submenu for even more movie and TV show links. | Always use the latest version of AV Edge app. | To check what version you currently are on, click SETTINGS and look for the version number in the bottom right corner of the screen. It starts with 99. | The current version is v18.8.16. | Remember, if you experience ‘sticking’ when streaming a movie, try pausing the movie for a minute or 2 at the beginning to allow it to build a sufficient buffer, then click play. *** </title>
